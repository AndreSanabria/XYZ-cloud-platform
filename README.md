# XYZ Business Operations Data Platform

This project is a complete full-stack SQL database solution for managing the internal operations of **XYZ Company**, a fictional mid-sized manufacturer. The system enables querying, visualization, and manipulation of company data including employees, customers, job applications, sales, products, parts, vendors, and more.

## 📚 Project Overview

XYZ Company manufactures products using vendor-supplied parts and operates across multiple departments and marketing sites. The database is designed to track:

- Employee information and supervisor relationships
- Departmental history of employees over time
- Job postings, applications, and interview results
- Product composition, part sourcing, and vendor pricing
- Sales data by site and customer
- Salaries, transactions, and staffing

The goal is to provide a **normalized, relational database** that supports **querying**, **views**, and **custom constraints** to simulate real-world business operations.
